# README
**1.What is the need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project?**

**2.Identify the problem you’re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App? Why is it a problem that needs solving?**

**3.Describe the project will you be conducting and how. your App will address the needs.**

**4.Describe the network infrastructure the App may be based on.**


**5.Identify and describe the software to be used in your App.**
		Balsamiq
		HTML5
		CSS3
		Bootstrap (CSS Framework for styling)
		Ruby on Rails 5.2.1
		Ruby 2.5.1
		Visual Studio Code (text editor)
		Trello ( project management)
		Git & Github (source countrol)
		Heroku (deployment)
		Google Fonts

**6.Identify the database to be used in your App and provide a justification for your choice.**
Postgresql- A relational, SQL database.
The object-relational database based on spreadsheet with a collection of tables provide easier visualization of the datas.




**Identify and describe the production database setup (i.e. postgres instance).**
Creating our database with Postgres, we generate the empty directory. In order to save our data, we have to create the table to specify the position of storage.
Our postgres instance is one to many relationships using 6 tables. [link to ERD] https://dbdiagram.io/d/5cc63f6cf7c5bb70c72fc97e .



**Describe the architecture of your App.**

Our app is written in Rails MVC architectural pattern. 
The code regarding data storage is written inside of a model, code shown to the user inside of a view and the logic or glue that connect the model and view into the controller.


**Explain the different high-level components (abstractions) in your App.**


**Detail any third party services that your App will use.**
AWS cloud services platform
STRIPE Implementing a payment system

**Describe (in general terms) the data structure of marketplace apps that are similar to your own (e.g. eBay, Airbnb).**
At the level of our first prototype, the structure is very similar with PINTEREST or INSTAGRAM. But our goal is to develop the features of being able to retrieve the sales commissions of the posts that users have created. So the final version of our app will be the mix of PINTEREST and all other online redirect shopping sites like LYST.

**Provide your database schema design.**



**Provide User stories for your App.**



**Provide Wireframes for your App.**
